# GitHub Readme Preview for a MERN Stack-Based Social Media App

## Project :A MERN Stack Social Media Platform

Hello and welcome to `MySocialMediaApp`! As a recent Computer Science graduate eager to leverage my understanding of the MERN stack, I developed this project to explore full-stack web development further. It is a Basic social media platform designed to provide users with the ability to share their memories.

### Key Features
- User Authentication
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Posts
- like Posts and delete Posts

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js (version 10.0 or above) and MongoDB installed on your machine. 

###Tech Stack

MongoDB Atlas: Used MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database, for data persistence.\
Express.js: Utilized Express.js to create a robust API server.\
React.js: Leveraged React.js to build a dynamic and responsive client-side application.\
Node.js: Used Node.js for the server-side environment.

### Getting Started

Here are the steps you can follow to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Use `git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/SocialHub.git` to clone the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   
   Use the ` cd server && npm install ` command in the server directory to install necessary dependencies.
   Use the ` cd client && npm install ` command in the server directory to install necessary dependencies.
3. **Setup Environment Variables**:

   Make sure to create a `.env` file in the server directory\
   ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sandbox.jadwj.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority\
   PORT=5000

5. **Start the Application**:

   Use `npm start` in the server directory to start the server, and the same command in the client directory to start the React application.

### Project Structure

- `./client` - Holds the React.js client-side code.
- `./server` - Contains the Express.js server-side code.
- `./server/models` - Defines the MongoDB database schemas.
- `./server/routes` - Contains the Express.js routing logic.
- `./server/controllers` - Contains the core business logic for data manipulation.
- `./server/middleware` - Houses any Express middleware functions.
